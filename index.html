 <!--Start out with the login on and see if you can get the player information into Firebase for the first player-->

<!--Make a multi-player rock paper scissors game using Firebase-->

<!--2 player setup and they can both login with a login name field and Start button to keep track of score-->

<!--Make three boxes for player interaction the two on the outside are the "players box" and the one in the middle is the status box-->

<!--In Firebase you can see the player objects along with turn indicator-->


<!--Make an array of choices for each player to choose from in their "player box" player can see what they chose as selection is highlighted or emphasized-->


<!--Alerts/Prompts at the top of the screen to tell players whose turn it is and if waiting on other player to make a choice, also the players "player box" is highlighted on both players screens.-->

<!--After both players make their choice the center box displays the winner and the game refreshes to original screen but with the new score increment displayed-->

<!--If there is a tie the center box displays tie but no score is incremented-->


<!--Build a Chat box and message board to sling comments at your opponent-->

<!--Player can leave by refreshing the page and a "player disconnected" text appears in the meassage board and removes the data from Firebase-->
